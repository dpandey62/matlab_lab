# Digital Image Processing
Digital Image Processing (DIP) is a software which is used to manipulate the digital images by the use of computer system. It is also used to enhance the images, to get some important information from it.

For example: Adobe Photoshop, MATLAB, etc.

It is also used in the conversion of signals from an image sensor into the digital images.

A certain number of algorithms are used in image processing.
